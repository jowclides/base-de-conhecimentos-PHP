# Base de Conhecimentos em PHP - PHP4YOU ( Emerson Silva )

## What is Base de Conhecimentos em PHP?

Base de Conhecimentos em PHP is a PHP full-stack web APP that is light, fast, flexible and secure.
More information can be found at the [official site](https://www.php4you.com.br).

This repository holds the distributable version of the framework,
including the user guide. It has been built from the
[development repository](https://github.com/jowclides/base-de-conhecimentos-PHP).

More information about the plans for version 2020 can be found in [the announcement](https://www.php4you.com.br) on the forums or downloads apps.

The user guide corresponding to this version of the framework can be found
[here](https://phpmaker.dev/docs/#/).


## Important Change with index.php

`index.php` is no longer in the root of the project! It has been moved inside the *public* folder,
for better security and separation of components.

This means that you should configure your web server to "point" to your project's *public* folder, and
not to the project root. A better practice would be to configure a virtual host to point there. A poor practice would be to point your web server to the project root and expect to enter *public/...*, as the rest of your logic and the
framework are exposed.

**Please** read the user guide for a better explanation of how CI4 works!

## Repository Management

We use Github issues, in our main repository, to track **BUGS** and to track approved **DEVELOPMENT** work packages.
We use our [forum](https://www.hkvforums.com/viewforum.php?f=27) to provide SUPPORT and to discuss
FEATURE REQUESTS.

This repository is a "distribution" one, built by our release preparation script.
Problems with it can be raised on our forum, or as issues in the main repository.
